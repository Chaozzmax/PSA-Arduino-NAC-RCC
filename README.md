# Arduino PSA Diag box

PSA NAC / RCC Diagbox Configuration software

fork of https://github.com/ludwig-v/arduino-psa-nac_rcc_cirocco 



# What's in this version

- This is the offline version (include seed/key algorithm). 
- You have an offline editor (to edit configuration at home before to send it to the car)
- Zone description instead of system name on main board (french only)
- .Net core for cross plateform execution (mac, linux, windows)


You have the source code as well if you want to improve it and better understand how it is working.
