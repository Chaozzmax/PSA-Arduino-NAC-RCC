# Arduino PSA Diag box

PSA NAC / RCC Diagbox Configuration software

fork of https://github.com/ludwig-v/arduino-psa-nac_rcc_cirocco 

Thanks to Vlud and Bagou91. 

# What's in this version

- This is the offline version (include seed/key algorithm). 
- You have an offline editor (to edit configuration at home before to send it to the car)
- Zone description instead of system name on main board (french only)


You have the source code as well if you want to improve it and better understand how it is working.
